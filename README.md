## Hack-A-Thing 2: Swift Tutorials
### Eun Kyung Yoon and Jasmine Mai

### What we did
For Hack-A-Thing 2, we played around with combining Swift with different technologies. We first delved into ARKit and created an augmented reality bug shooting game. Then, we learned about blockchain and followed a tutorial to create our own Blockchain Web API.

Tutorials Followed:
* Bug Shooting AR Game: https://www.raywenderlich.com/378-augmented-reality-and-arkit-tutorial
* Blockchain and Swift: https://www.lynda.com/Web-Development-tutorials/Blockchain-Programming-iOS-Using-Swift/779750-2.html

We both followed along on the ARKit and Swift tutorial, so we were partner programmed through the entire tutorial together. In terms of commits, Jasmine coded the first parts of the ARKit and Swift tutorial and the Blockchain tutorial. This consisted of setting up the project, setting the permissions, setting up the initial anchors for the bugs, adding a single bug, and adding shooting capability. Andy commited the rest of the tutorial, including adding level design, adding different types of bugs, adding a bug spray capability, adding anchor collision so that objects would disapper, and adding sound.

For the Swift and blockchain tutorial, we divided up the tutorial. Jasmine did the first parts of the tutorial: setting up the blocks, blockchain, transaction classes. Andy used vapor to deploy the blockchain code to a Web API and decentralized the blockchain.


### What we Learned
* Swift!
* How ArKit works, and some basic concepts regarding AR development (matrices, transformation matrices, etc.)
* Blockchain
* Vapor and creating a server side Swift


### Relating to possible project ideas
We wanted to possibly create an AR project, so learning about ARKit was really useful. Also, learning about Swift gave us an alternative to React-Native for creating mobile apps.

### What didn't work
Code signing for one of the laptops XCode did not work for one of our laptops, probably because the account did not have admin access to the laptop
